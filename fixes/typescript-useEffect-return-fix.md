# TypeScript useEffect Return Fix

## Problem
**File**: `src/ui/components/OperationExecutor.tsx`  
**Error**: `TS7030: Not all code paths return a value.`

The `useEffect` hook in `OperationExecutor.tsx` was missing an explicit return statement for the case when the conditions weren't met, causing a TypeScript compilation error.

## Root Cause
TypeScript's strict mode requires that all code paths in a function return a value. The `useEffect` hook was only returning a cleanup function when the conditions were met, but had no return statement for the else case.

## Solution
Added an explicit `return undefined;` statement for the case when the conditions aren't met:

```typescript
useEffect(() => {
  if (lastResponse?.success && lastResponse.data?.excelOperations?.length && !isProcessing) {
    // Auto-execute after a short delay to let user see what will happen
    const timer = setTimeout(() => {
      handleExecute();
    }, 1000);
    
    return () => clearTimeout(timer);
  }
  return undefined; // Explicit return for when conditions aren't met
}, [lastResponse, isProcessing]);
```

## Impact
- ✅ TypeScript compilation now passes
- ✅ No functional changes to the component behavior
- ✅ Maintains proper cleanup when conditions are met
- ✅ Follows React best practices for useEffect

## Testing
- Verified with `npm run type-check`
- All existing tests continue to pass
- No runtime behavior changes

## Prevention
To prevent similar issues:
1. Always ensure useEffect has explicit return statements for all code paths
2. Use TypeScript strict mode to catch these issues early
3. Consider using ESLint rules for React hooks
4. Add unit tests for useEffect cleanup scenarios
